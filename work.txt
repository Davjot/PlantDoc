Here discussuion of implementing detection accuracy will be there:

Implemented yolov5 model with no augmentation of image size 416x416 using roboflow.

Implemented yolov8 model with no augmentation of image size 640x640 using roboflow.

Trying yolov5 model with augmentation changes(Flip: horizontal and Vertical, 90deg rotate: counter clockwise , clockwise and upside down) 
of image size 416x416 using roboflow.

trying yolov5n model with acc of 50s in that model.

and try yolov7 also on that model.

Later try: yolov7 model.
