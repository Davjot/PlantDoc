Here discussuion of implementing detection accuracy will be there:

Implemented yolov5 model with no augmentation of image size 416x416 using roboflow.

Implemented yolov8 model with no augmentation of image size 640x640 using roboflow.

Trying yolov5 model with augmentation changes(Flip: horizontal and Vertical, 90deg rotate: counter clockwise , clockwise and upside down) 
of image size 416x416 using roboflow.

Try: batch size 8, optimiser Adam and epochs 300 on yolov5s model.

applying 416x416 on yolov5 with image and bounding box augmentation.

Later try: yolov7 model.
